# CourseDev2

This set of files is from the summer of 2015, when I worked on a course development team for OSU's new online Data Analytics M.S. program. I was in charge of writing the lab handout for each module, covering module specific statistics and R skills. I wrote the labs in R Markdown; the .pdf, .R, .rmd, and sometimes a .csv file are included. These labs were for ST517.
